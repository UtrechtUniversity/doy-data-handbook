# Data Management Planning

A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a formal document that: 

- describes your data, and,

- outlines all aspects of managing your data, both during and after your project. 

It is also a living document, it can (and should) be continually edited and updated. 

A DMP helps make your RDM activities more concrete and actionable. It will save you time, work, and potentially money too.
