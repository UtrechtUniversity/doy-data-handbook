Imagine automating the clicks and typing of going to a specific website, logging in, clicking the download button.\nYou can use Windows Task Scheduler / cron / the taskscheduleR R package / cronR to schedule your scripts to run automatically, on a recurring basis as well (if needed).\nYou can also send emails with R & Python! Consider if you’ve ever had to contact participants because you noticed something wrong with their incoming data. You could implement these data checks with a script and automatically draft and send emails (from a template) to those participants who were flagged as having issues with their data."
