## What 
When discussing storage, we refer to the location of ‘active’ data, which is in use and may change throughout the research project.
The related concepts of archiving and publishing refer to where the data will be saved or deposited áfter the project is completed.

## Why
Storing data properly ensures that research can be conducted efficiently, prevents data loss, and maintains the integrity and reproducibility of results. Well-managed storage supports collaboration, version control, and easy retrieval of files during the project.

## Who 
When planning data storage, consider potential sharing with other researchers. Decisions about who will access the data and how often it will be shared affect both where the data is stored and how it is organized, backed up, and structured.

##When
Active data must be stored securely at all times, with regular backups and version control to prevent loss or accidental overwriting.

## Where 
The [Data Storage Finder](https://tools.uu.nl/storagefinder/) is a tool provided by IT help you decide which storage solution would be most suited to your needs.

## How
When storing data, consider the following
- choose storage media that is appropriate for the type of data you're working with
- implement reliable version control and backups
- structure folders and organize files clearly
- follow a naming convention
- use preferred and sustainable file formats
- secure data files
