## What

Metadata refers to _structured_ and _machine-readable_ information that describes one or more aspects of your research data. In other words, metadata = "data about data."

## Why

Metadata that is structured and machine-readable makes your data **findable** and **citable**, improving accessibility and reusability.

## Who

Researchers working with the data, as well as those involved in archiving and publishing, are responsible for ensuring metadata of sufficient quality.

## When

Ideally, you will generate some metadata over the course of your project. At a minimum, metadata should be created before archiving and publication.

## Where

Metadata should be made available alongside your data. This would be within your project folder during the active stage of your project and in your data package at the archiving and publication stages.

## How

Metadata exists at different levels:

### Project-Level Metadata

This describes higher-order aspects of your dataset: the "who, what, where, when, how, and why." It provides context for understanding why the data were collected and how they were used. Examples include:

- Name of the project  
- Dataset title  
- Project description  
- Dataset abstract  
- Principal investigator and collaborators  
- Contact information  
- Dataset handle (DOI or URL)  
- Dataset citation  
- Data publication date  
- Geographic description  
- Time period of data collection  
- Subjects / keywords  
- Project sponsor  
- Dataset usage rights  

Project-level metadata is typically entered into a metadata form on your chosen data repository.

### Data-Level Metadata

This is more granular and describes the data (variables) and dataset in detail. Examples include:

- _Data origin_: experimental, observational, raw or derived, physical collections, models, images, etc.  
- _Data type_: integer, Boolean, character, floating point, etc.  
- Instruments used  
- _Data acquisition details_: sensor deployment, experimental design, sensor calibration methods, etc.  
- _File type_: CSV, MAT, XLSX, TIFF, HDF, NetCDF, etc.  
- Data processing methods and software used  
- Data processing scripts or code  
- Dataset parameter list, including:
  - Variable names  
  - Description of each variable  
  - Units  

Some data-level metadata can be included in repository metadata forms, but is typically captured in [codebooks](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/doy-data-handbook/codebooks.html)/data dictionaries and or project [documentation](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/doy-data-handbook/documentation.html).
