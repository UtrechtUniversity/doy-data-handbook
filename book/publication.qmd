When publishing (meta)data, you want to make it findable and reusable. The data (and information about the data) can be used by others for their own purposes. It's up to you to specify the terms and conditions for access and reuse.

Note that your data need not be 'open' to be FAIR! The data files themselves can be placed under restricted access (or retained internally) while the metadata and documentation are openly published. Once any data sharing agreements are signed, the data files an be transferred according to best practices.

When publishing (meta)data, you will receive a landing page for your dataset and a DOI (persistent identifier) that makes it findable and citeable. When you include your metadata and documentation, you improve accessibility and reusability.
