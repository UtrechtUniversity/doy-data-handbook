The Data Handbook for Dynamics of Youth provides information and resources on research data management and making data pertaining to youth research _Findable_, _Accessible_, _Interoperable_, and _Reusable_ (FAIR).

The Handbook need not be read from start to finish, like a textbook. You are invited to navigate to the topic you need based on the table of contents. As far as possible, the chapters have been written concisely - emphasizing practical tips or links to existing resources.
