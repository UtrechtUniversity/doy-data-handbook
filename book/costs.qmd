# Costs {.unnumbered}
 
We consider data management costs all expenses that are associated with planning, collecting, storing, analysing, publishing, sharing and archiving research data during the research life cycle of a project. It encompasses the finances needed to obtain licenses for data re-use, acquiring the tools for working with your data or hiring the expertise to support the research project.

## Why is it important?
Considering data-management costs explicitly is essential for ensuring that the necessary resources are available throughout the project. Many activities—such as storage, documentation, data cleaning, or long-term archiving—require time, expertise, and infrastructure, which can lead to unanticipated expenses if not planned in advance. Transparent budgeting helps avoid delays, ensures compliance with funder and institutional requirements, and supports sustainable data practices.

## Who is responsible
Responsibility for identifying and budgeting data-management costs lies primarily with the research team, as they best understand the scope and requirements of their project. However, institutions play a key supporting role: data stewards, IT services or RDM support units provide guidance on expected expenses, available infrastructure, and compliant cost planning. Effective cost management therefore depends on shared responsibility between researchers, their departments, and the institutional services that offer expertise and resources.

## Where
These costs arise throughout all phases of a research project: from the initial planning stage, through data collection and processing, to final archiving, sharing, or publication. Additional costs may occur when data is obtained externally, stored in (cloud) infrastructures, or shared with third parties.

## How
•	Plan data-management costs early, including in grant proposals, by drafting a preliminary Data Management Plan (DMP). This helps make storage, documentation, analysis, backup, and archiving costs explicit.

•	Identify which data-related tasks are needed at each project stage (e.g., collecting, transcribing, anonymizing, structuring, documenting, sharing, archiving) and estimate the required time and resources, using suggested hourly rates for student assistants or data professionals where possible.

•	Whenever feasible, use institutional or open-source infrastructure and tools instead of expensive external services, and rely on templates, standards, and standard operating procedures to increase efficiency and reduce costs.
